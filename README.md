#  CompareKart — Real-Time Product Comparison App

CompareKart is a full-stack web application that lets users search and compare products from Amazon and Meesho in real-time.

--> CompareKart was created as part of my job-focused learning strategy. I wanted a project that:
 • Solves a real-world problem (product comparison)
  • Covers full-stack skills — scraping,frontend, backend.
  • Demonstrates problem-solving under real site restrictions (anti-bot, dynamic content)


## Tech Stack
Frontend :  React, Tailwind CSS, Axios, NProgress

Backend  :  Node.js, Express, Cheerio, Puppeteer

Scraping Targets : Amazon, Meesho
